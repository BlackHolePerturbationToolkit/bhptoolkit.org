## Project List

Current **Mathematica** projects in the Toolkit include:

* [SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics](https://blackholeperturbationtoolkit.github.io/SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics): Tools for computing spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics and their associated eigenvalues.
* [KerrGeodesics](https://blackholeperturbationtoolkit.github.io/KerrGeodesics): Tools for computing bound timelike geodesics about a Kerr black hole.
* [Teukolsky](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/Teukolsky): A set of functions for computing solutions to the Teukolsky equation for perturbations of the spacetime of a Kerr black hole.
* [QuasiNormalModes](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/QuasiNormalModes): Tools for computing quasinormal modes in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetime
* [GeneralRelativityTensors](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/GeneralRelativityTensors): Provides a set of functions for performing coordinate-based tensor calculations with a focus on general relativity and black holes in particular.

Current **C/C++** projects in the Toolkit include:

* [Fast Self-forced Inspirals](https://blackholeperturbationtoolkit.github.io/Fast_Self-Forced_Inspirals/): Code to compute self-force inspirals rapidly using the near-identity transformed (NIT'd) equations of motion.
* [EMRI Kludge Suite](https://github.com/alvincjk/EMRI_Kludge_Suite): A suite of software for computing kludge waveforms for generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals into a Kerr black hole.
* [Gremlin](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/GremlinEq): Code to solve the Teukolsky equation with a point-particle source

Current **Python** projects in the Toolkit include:

* [kerrgeodesic_gw](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw): Code to compute the gravitational waves from a particle on a circular orbit about a Kerr black hole. Also included is code to compute spin weighted spheroidal harmonics.

A range of further tools are being developed and will be added as the project expands. There is also a **repository of results** associated with the Toolkit. Current publicly available results include:

* [PostNewtonian-SelfForce](http://bhptoolkit.org/PostNewtonianSelfForce/): Results for various quantities to high post-Newtonian order and linear-order in the mass ratio.
* [RegularizationParameters](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/RegularizationParameters): Regularization parameters to compute the regular field at the particle.
* [Circular Orbit Self-force Data](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/CircularOrbitSelfForceData): Numerical data for fluxes and self-force quantities for circular orbits

We also have **example code** which demonstrates how to use various pieces of the Toolkit:

 * [Mathematica Toolkit Examples](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/MathematicaToolkitExamples): Examples using the Mathematica modules of the Toolkit
