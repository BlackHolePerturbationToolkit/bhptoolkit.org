## Documentation

Each module comes with its own documentation. Currently, in places this can be quite minimal but we are continuously working to improve this. Soon we have have direct links to the Mathematica documentation here, as well as links to the documentation for other key modules.

## Reporting issues or making suggestions

We do our best to ensure the components of the Toolkit work correctly but inevitably errors will slip through our tests. If you find something you think is in error please do report it via the issue tracker associated with the corresponding repository. Similarly, if you have a suggestion for new features these can also be added to the issue trackers. See our [issue tracker information page](issue-tracker-info.html) for a guide on using the issue trackers.

## Unit testing

One of the aims of the toolkit is for all components to be well-tested and reliable. Every commit is tested using a Jenkins continuous integration server. This means each time the code is changed it is automatically tested to ensure no errors have been introduced. You can find the current build status at [build.bhptoolkit.org](http://build.bhptoolkit.org/blue) (password protected for security reasons).

## Naming conventions

We aim to have consistent naming conventions in use across the Toolkit. The current list can be found on the [name conventions page](conventions.html).
