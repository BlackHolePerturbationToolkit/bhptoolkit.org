# Toolkit Contributors and Users

Building the Toolkit is a global, community effort and the fruits of that work are used even more widely. The below map shows the location of the developers, contributors and users of the Toolkit.

The location of the lead institutions are shown in red, contributors are shown in blue and users in yellow. If you fall into any of these categories and are missing from the map us know so we can add you.
