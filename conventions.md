## Conventions

Throughout the Toolkit we use adimensionalized quantities to parametrize. The primary and secondary masses and spins are denoted by

- $M$ - the mass of the primary
- $a$ - the primary spin

- $\mu$ - the mass of the secondary
- $\sigma$ - the secondary spin

#### Spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics

- $\lambda$ - the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonic eigenvalue. Here we use the defintion of [].

#### Geodesic motion

- p - the semi-latus rectum
- e - the orbital eccentricity

$r_p = \frac{pM}{1+ e\cos\chi_r}$
