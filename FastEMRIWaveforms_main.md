FastEMRIWaveforms is a Python package that generates "blazingly fast" and accurate EMRI waveforms with both CPU and GPU capabilities. There are pure Python modules as well as Python modules that wrap C/C++ and CUDA code.  Additionally, FastEMRIWaveforms provides a highly modular framework that allows users to build in custom modules particular to their model. Currently, the package contains Schwarzschild eccentric waveforms and various separate modules used to create them. We expect this to evolve in the near future.
