# Black Hole Perturbation Theory

Black hole perturbation theory is a technique for modeling black hole spacetimes which are a small perturbation away from a known exact black hole solutions of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. These spacetimes typically occur during compact binary coalescences if one object is much more massive than the other, or (for all mass ratio binaries) just after the binary coalescences (the so-called 'ringdown').

Careful modeling of these systems allows accurate models of the emitted gravitational waves to be constructed. These template waveforms theoreticians predict are then used to detect and estimate the source parameter for astrophysical gravitational wave sources. Ringdown models are used in searches with currently running ground-based detectors such as [LIGO](http://ligo.org/) and [Virgo](http://www.virgo-gw.eu/). Small mass-ratio binaries are key sources for the future space-based [LISA detector](https://www.lisamission.org/).

## Small mass-ratio binaries

The below video shows an example of a complicated motion of a neutron star (with mass about one and half times that of our sun) about an intermediate mass black hole (mass about 3,000 times our sun). The motion is shown at its natural speed, is drawn accurately, and has a thirty second tail.
