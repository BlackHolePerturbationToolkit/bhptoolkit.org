# Installing Mathematica Packages for developers

Most users should install Mathematica packages via the [Paclet server](mathematica-install.html). Developers should install the packages directly via git. You will find the link to the GitHub repository at the bottom of each of the packages webpages. You should then clone the repository into the Applications folder inside the UserBaseDirectory. You can find where the UserBaseDirectory is on your system by opening Mathematica and typing

```
$UserBaseDirectory
```

If you are looking for things to work on in a particular package then a good place to start is by looking at the issue tracker. More information about that can be found on our [issue tracker info page](issue-tracker-info.html).

If you are working on the webpage for a package then see our [gh-pages guide](http://bhptoolkit.org/gh-pages).
