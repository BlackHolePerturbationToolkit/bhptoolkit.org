- End-to-end usage: installation, running code, interpreting results
- Lots of time for discussion and actively hacking on code and documentation
- Future roadmap for codes and datasets

## Workshop @ MIT

The first Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit workshop will take place at MIT from the 11th - 13th of March. The venue will be in the Kavli Institute on Vassar Street, Cambridge. This is a short walk from the Kendall Square/MIT T-stop on the Red line (subway).
