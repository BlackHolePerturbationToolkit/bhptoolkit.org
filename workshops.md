# Toolkit Workshops

In 2019 two toolkit workshops will take place in March, one hosted at MIT and the other at UCD in Dublin. Each workshop will be three days long and will cover:  

- Introduction and overview of the Toolkit
- End-to-end usage: installation, running code, interpreting results
- Lots of time for discussion and actively hacking on code and documentation
- Future roadmap for codes and datasets

If you have any questions about any aspect of the workshops please contact Niels Warburton at [niels.warburton@ucd.ie](mailto:niels.warburton@ucd.ie).

## Workshop @ MIT

The first Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit workshop will take place at MIT from the 11th - 13th of March. The venue will be in the Kavli Institute on Vassar Street, Cambridge. This is a short walk from the Kendall Square/MIT T-stop on the Red line (subway).

#### Accommodation

Anywhere along the Red subway line is ideal as this provides easy access to MIT. Accommodation in the Boston area can be expensive so we recommend booking something as soon as possible.

#### Attendees

Alvin Chua, Steve Drasco, Lisa Drummond, Charles Evans, Scott Field, Gaurav Khanna, Halston Lim, Karna Morey, Lionel London, Scott Hughes, Zach Nasipak, Chris Munna, Adrian Ottewill, Thomas Osburn, Niels Warburton, Barry Wardell
