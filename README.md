# Website for the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit

This repository contains the website for the BHPToolkit. The website is automatically built by GitHub using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you want to test changes to the website before pushing them install Jekyll, navigate to the directory containing the site and execute `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can now view the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

With Jekyll running locally every time you make a change to the source the site is regenerated. Once you are happy with the changes you can push them to the repository (note, the local Jekyll server will create an _sites directory that should not be added to the repository).
