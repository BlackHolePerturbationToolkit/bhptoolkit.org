# Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit

The Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit provides a set of open tools for black hole perturbation theory.

## Project List

Current projects in the toolkit include:

* [SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics](https://blackholeperturbationtoolkit.github.io/spinweightedspheroidalharmonics): Tools for computing spin-weighted spherical harmonics and their associated eigenvalues.

More tools will be added as the project expands.
